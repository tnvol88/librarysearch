***** TO INSTALL PYTHON ******
You will need to have Python3 installed. You can download the current version from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
This will also download an installer which will guide you through installing python.

Once python is installed, navigate through your file explorer to find the path where Python was installed. For example mine is: 
  C:/Python34. You need to know this in order to run the script.
  
  If you open the python folder, you will see a number of pre-installed folders already. I have created a new folder to keep the programs
  I write in. I call this folder, "Programs". My new path for running scripts is now C:/Python34/Programs. Creating a folder just for 
  new programs is completely optional, I just use it to stay organized better.
  
You'll notice inside your new python folder, there is a folder titled "Scripts". In this folder is a tool called 'pip' which allows for
    easy installation of python libraries. The path for accessing pip in the command prompt will be the 'path to your pythonfolder'+/Scripts
    for example: C:/Python34/Scripts
  
  
***** TO SAVE SCRIPT *****
Navigate through the following - Python installation folder -> Lib -> idlelib -> idle.pyw
You now have the Python Idle Shell running. Select 'File' -> 'New File' to create a document
Paste the code from github here and save to your desired location within the python installation folder


***** TO DOWNLOAD PYTHON LIBRARIES NEEDED *****
Open your command prompt (windows key+r and then type cmd on windows). Or you can search through your applications. Typically found under
    accessories.
    
Change to python script directory using change directory command. for example I will type: cd C:/Python34/Scripts
    You will need to type the path to your python scripts folder - This is case sensitive and errors will be thrown if cases do not match
    the appropriate path. When successful, the prompt within the command prompt will change to reflect the python script directory.
    Ex. C:\Python334\Scripts> "this is the area I woul type commands"
    You might notice that when I use the cd command I utilize forward slashes while the command prompt shows paths with back slashes.
        Either works, but back slashes have a special command in python and so I use forward slashes out of habit. You don't have to know
        that to make this work, but don't want you to be confused by the mixed use of slashes.
        
To install googleplaces api library: 
    here is a link to the library and additional installation instructions: https://github.com/slimkrazy/python-google-places
    In your command prompt, type the following and then press enter: pip install python-google-places
        You should see a bunch of installation processes begin. You may be asked to type 'y' at one point.
        
To install openpyxl:
    type the following and press enter: pip install openpyxl


***** FINAL STEPS *****
In order for the script to find the excel file, it needs to be in the same path as the script itself. Copy/Paste or otherwise 
    move the excel file to the same folder where you have the script saved.
    
    
***** TO RUN SCRIPT *****
In the command prompt, 'cd' to the path where the sript is saved (also where the excel file is saved). This is the path to the folder
    where the items are located. For example I would type: cd C:/Python34/Programs

Now type (without quotes) 'nameofscript.py' and press enter.
